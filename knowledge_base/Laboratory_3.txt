One of several Programmical Laboratories that operate within the influence and city limits of Shadowcliff, Laboratory 3 is one of the closest of such facilities to the Central Command station and the FÃ¼hrer's official residence. As described  early in the series by Stephen Banks, Laboratory 3 does not seem to have any significant experiments under operation, but this unassuming lab hides a rather dark secret: beneath Lab 3, in a sealed-off area, lies the entrance to a secret facility in which untold human experiments were conducted as well as a tunnel that leads directly to the inner sanctum of Amaryllis and the other Homunculi.
Though mentioned during the Laboratory 5 arc, Laboratory 3 is first seen during the "Fishing" Mission orchestrated by Colonel Scott Jefferson. After the body of Barry the Chopper is chased away from Warrant Officer Vato Falman's safehouse, Barry (in his armor vessel), Jefferson, Lt. Jennifer Spencer, 2nd Lt. Susan Hill and Tammy Banks follow it into the depths of Lab 3, where the team splits off in different directions to find clues. While Barry, Spencer and Tammy make it to the very doors of Amaryllis's lair, Jefferson and Havoc encounter Prudery in the human experimentation lab, to devastating results.
When Stephen Banks returns to investigate Lab 3 according to Tam's instructions, he notices that the entrance to the underground area - previously sealed off by a locked gate - has now been completely covered up with programming.
